------------------------ How to compile page ----------------------------------

Navigate to my-app folder in the terminal. Run the command, "npm start" and
open a browser with the url http://localhost:3000/


------------------------ User / Design Principles -----------------------------

I used very simple, sans serif fonts because the page is on a website. I
wanted the text to be very simple so that it could display the information
and not detract from the Pokemon names themselves. This would allow users to get the
info they need fastest. This is ultimately the goal of users, especially
if they are using the filtering/sorting tools.

Additionally, I used CSS grid to organize all the buttons and the Pokemon.
All the photos and text elements are aligned with each other.

While the page is very simple, I thought that a minimalistic design was best
at portraying the information on the page. The pokemon themselves already have
a lot of colors and adding too many visual elements (ie flashy images, colorful
backgrounds, etc) on the page detracted from the Pokemon images and info.

The buttons themselves are obvious. Dropdowns have an arrow to indicate
they have options, and the sorting buttons are attached to show the options are either
one or the other (Pokedex / Alphabetical). Additionally, there are words to
tell users how to use the buttons, which are Sort by, Filter by, or Search
respectively.
